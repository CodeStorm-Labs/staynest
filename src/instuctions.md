Project: Full-Stack Airbnb-like PlatformYour Role: You are an expert Senior Full-Stack Developer with extensive experience in Next.js, modern database solutions, and building scalable, secure, and user-friendly web applications. You will be responsible for architecting and implementing the entire platform from the ground up. Your code should be clean, well-documented, and follow best practices.Core Objective: Develop a feature-rich, production-ready web application that mimics the core functionalities of Airbnb, with a primary focus on the Turkish market and an option for English language support.Tech Stack:Frontend: Next.js (App Router preferred), React, Tailwind CSS (or your preferred modern CSS framework, please state if different and why)Backend: Next.js API Routes, Node.jsDatabase: PostgreSQL (or suggest an alternative if you have a strong reason, e.g., Supabase, Firebase Firestore, MongoDB, explaining the trade-offs)Authentication: NextAuth.js (or a similar robust solution)Deployment: Vercel (or suggest alternatives suitable for Next.js)Internationalization (i18n): A library like next-intl or react-i18next to support Turkish (default) and English languages.Key Libraries/Tools (to consider and suggest):State Management (e.g., Zustand, Redux Toolkit, React Context)Data Fetching/Caching (e.g., SWR, React Query)Image Uploads & Management (e.g., Cloudinary, AWS S3)Mapping (e.g., Mapbox, Google Maps API via react-map-gl or similar)Date/Time Management (e.g., date-fns, Day.js)Form Handling (e.g., React Hook Form)UI Components (e.g., Shadcn/UI, Headless UI, or custom components)Testing (Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress)Key Features to Implement (Iteratively):Phase 1: Core User & Listing ManagementUser Authentication:Sign up (Email/Password, Google/GitHub OAuth)Login/LogoutPassword ResetUser Profile (view/edit basic info, profile picture)Property Listings:For Hosts:Create new listings (property type, location, description, amenities, photos, price, availability calendar)Edit existing listingsView their own listingsManage bookings for their propertiesFor Guests:View all listings (with search and filtering)View individual listing details (photos, description, amenities, map, reviews, host info, price, availability)Search & Filtering:Search by location (city, address)Filter by dates (check-in/check-out)Filter by number of guestsFilter by price rangeFilter by property type (e.g., apartment, house, unique stay)Filter by amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, kitchen, pool)Database Schema Design: Design and implement a robust schema for users, listings, bookings, reviews, etc. Please present the initial schema for review before extensive implementation. Consider how to store translatable content if property descriptions, etc., need to be multi-language.Internationalization (i18n) Setup:Implement basic i18n structure.All UI text (buttons, labels, navigation, static content) should be managed through i18n keys.Default language: Turkish.Secondary language: English.Implement a language switcher.Phase 2: Booking & ReviewsBooking System:Guests can select dates and book a property.Availability check before booking.Booking confirmation.View their upcoming and past bookings.Review System:Guests can leave reviews (rating + text) for properties they've stayed at.Hosts can see reviews for their properties.Reviews are displayed on listing pages.Phase 3: Advanced Features & PolishMapping Integration:Display properties on a map for search results.Show property location on the listing detail page.Image Handling:Secure image uploads for listings.Optimized image delivery.Notifications (Basic):Email notifications (in the user's selected language) for new bookings (to host and guest), booking confirmations, and new reviews (to host).Responsive Design: Ensure the application is fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.Basic Admin Dashboard (Optional, if time permits):View all users, listings, bookings.Ability to manage (e.g., deactivate) users or listings.Development Process & Expectations:Iterative Development: We will build this feature by feature. Please focus on one core area at a time.Communication: Provide clear explanations for your design choices, especially regarding architecture, database schema, and library selections.Code Quality: Write clean, modular, well-commented, and testable code.Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.Security: Prioritize security best practices (XSS prevention, CSRF protection, secure API endpoints, proper data validation).Scalability: Keep scalability in mind for future growth.Directory Structure: Please propose a clean and maintainable directory structure for the Next.js project, including considerations for i18n resource files.Initial Task:Set up the Next.js (App Router) project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.Implement the basic project structure (folders for components, routes, lib, utils, i18n, etc.).Set up NextAuth.js for basic email/password authentication (sign up, login, logout).Set up the chosen i18n library (e.g., next-intl) for Turkish and English, including a basic language switcher.Create the initial database schema design for Users and Listings. Present this schema for review, noting any fields that might need to support multiple languages (e.g., if property descriptions are translated by users or automatically).Let's start by discussing the initial setup, your i18n strategy, and your proposed database schema. I'm ready to collaborate and provide feedback.
